## Javascript Anti-Patterns

Excerpt from [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#antipatterns)

- Polluting the global namespace by defining a large number of variables in the global context
- Passing strings rather than functions to either `setTimeout` or `setInterval` as this triggers the use of `eval()` internally.
- Modifying the Object class prototype (this is a particularly bad anti-pattern)
- Using JavaScript in an inline form as this is inflexible
- The use of `document.write` where native DOM alternatives such as `document.createElement` are more appropriate. `document.write` has been grossly misused over the years and has quite a few disadvantages including that if it's executed after the page has been loaded it can actually overwrite the page we're on, whilst `document.createElement` does not. We can see here for a live example of this in action. It also doesn't work with XHTML which is another reason opting for more DOM-friendly methods such as `document.createElement` is favorable.

"Knowledge of anti-patterns is critical for success. Once we are able to recognize such anti-patterns, we're able to refactor our code to negate them so that the overall quality of our solutions improves instantly."
